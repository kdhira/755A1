## Running the application
`python3 a1.py data_set_name [test_data_location]`

where `data_set_name` is one of: `world_cup_2018_clf`, `world_cup_2018_reg`, `traffic_flow`, `occupancy_sensor`, or `landsat`

providing a value for test_data_location (location on disk relative to current directory) will use an external test csv source for testing the models. This csv must be in the same format as the training data (see the data/ directory for the training data csvs)
